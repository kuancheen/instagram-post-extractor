A premium web application for extracting post descriptions and performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on images from public Instagram posts, reels, and direct image URLs.

## Purpose

Built to simplify the process of gathering textual information from social media posts, handling CORS constraints, and providing a high-fidelity user experience.

## Features

- **Meta Extraction**: Extracts `og:description` and `og:image` from Instagram posts and reels using robust proxy fallbacks.
- **Direct Image Support**: Paste high-resolution image URLs directly — supports Unsplash, Picsum, FastDL, and standard image formats.
- **Multi-Image Carousel**: Handle multiple comma-separated URLs with a thumbnail carousel for easy switching.
- **OCR Engine**: Powerful text extraction from images powered by Tesseract.js with live progress.
- **Proxy Reliability**: Automatic retries, proxy switching, and localStorage persistence for improved uptime.
- **Premium Design**: Glassmorphic dark-mode UI with animated gradients, smooth transitions, and micro-interactions.
- **Responsive**: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Zero Pop-up Policy**: All feedback via inline, context-aware messaging — no `alert()` or `confirm()`.
